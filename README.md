## Editor

This editor provides a few formatting options, such as headers, bold, italics, quotes, and hyperlinks, which are styled similarly to Medium.
It archives the writing with the following format:

  - First line of the writing: Title
  - Second line of the writing: Subtitle
  - The entire writing: Full content
  - Last edited date

This editor has an auto-save feature.  The writing will be automatically saved after a certain amount of time has passed when the user has stopped typing.

## Side Pane

The hamburger menu will 'pull and squeeze' in wide display, or it will 'pop-over' when viewing in small display sizes.
The writings will be listed in chronological order of creation with the latest on the top to the oldest on the bottom.
